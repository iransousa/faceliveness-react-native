AWS Face liveness React Native

Files required to integrate AWS FaceLiveness android with React native.

This week I will post a complete example for Android and iOS. For now, I will leave the necessary files to work on Android and the way I did the integration. In this case, I used temporary credentials on behalf of the client who uses this authentication model, but I tested it with AWS Cognito. directly on Android which also works.

I can't share the application I made for contract reasons, but I'll put together a basic example and a working video.
